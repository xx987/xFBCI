# Explainable Federated Bayesian Causal Inference  

This repository contains the implementation of the code associated with the paper: **_Explainable Federated Bayesian Causal Inference
and Its Application in Advanced Manufacturing_**.  

## Overview  
The project implements a framework of **Explainable Federated Bayesian Causal Inference (xFBCI)**.  






## Usage Instructions
Run the code in FederatedLearning.py (with appropriate comments for different cases) using the corresponding dataset to replicate the simulations in Section 4.
Please ensure the number of clients and dimension settings are configured correctly.



## Requirements

### Software

- **Python**: Version 3.xx (Recommended version: 3.12)
- **pip**: Python's package installer (make sure pip is up to date)

### Python Libraries
To install the necessary libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

```bash
python3.12 FederatedLearning.py
```
